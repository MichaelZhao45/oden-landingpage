# oden-landingpage

Start of Project - July 18, 2023

This Oden Projet project will be a landing page that will be made from scratch.  The Oden Project will provide the design.
In this project, I will be tested on what I learned previously in the course, which includes HTML, CSS and Flexbox.  
This will all be packaged into scaling a landing page from the ground up, which will be a learning experience.

Problem in Development - July 22, 2023

I'm running into this problem where some files or my repository were corrupted.  I did a command I found on the web, however, this resulted in me having to clone my repository which lead to another issue.
I am able to commit and push changes into my repository, this doesn't stop me from working on my project.  But, when I enter "git submodule status" into the terminal, the error pops up, "fatal: no submodule mapping found in .git modules for path 'oden-landingpage'."  Furthermore, making it so my checks aren't successful, the error in the file is below...

Error: fatal: No url found for submodule path 'oden-landingpage' in .gitmodules
  Error: The process '/usr/bin/git' failed with exit code 128

On the bright side, I am still able to develop the project and push my changes.  This curb in development will not stop me from finishing what I have started.

End of Project - July 25, 2023

This project has had its ups and downs.  The corrupted repo has now affected the website's ability to deploy on the web.  This is a problem as a website is only good if it can be viewed and accessed. 
However, I did learn a lot from this project that I will take into my future projects.  This includes but is not limited to...

1) Stuff happens
   - No matter what you do, something will happen that will cause you problems.  Even if it's something you're not expecting.
2) Html, CSS and Flexbox
   - Basic but very important web development tools.
3) Building a website from the ground up
   - Starting with the foundation of HTML, to the styling of CSS to the organization of Flexbox.  This project has given me a solid foundation.
  
Overall, this project was very enjoyable and a great learning experience.  As I progress in my web development journey through The Oden Project, I will definitely reflect on this experience as I grow as a developer.
I will try to fix the problem in the future when I have free time...
